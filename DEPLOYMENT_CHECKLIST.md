## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: GitHub Setup
- [ ] Push all changes to GitHub
- [ ] Verify all files are in the repository
- [ ] Check that the main branch is up to date

### Step 2: Render Account
- [ ] Create Render account at [render.com](https://render.com)

- [ ] Verify repository access

### Step 3: Deploy with Blueprint
- [ ] Click "New +" in Render dashboard
- [ ] Select "Blueprint"
- [ ] Choose your GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify `render.yaml` is detected
- [ ] Click "Apply" to deploy both services

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
- [ ] Watch backend API deployment
- [ ] Watch frontend deployment
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify services are running

### Step 5: Test Application
- [ ] Test backend API endpoints
- [ ] Test frontend functionality
- [ ] Verify CORS is working
- [ ] Check database connectivity

## üîß Manual Deployment (If Blueprint Fails)

### Backend API Service
- [ ] Create new Web Service
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build command: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.render.txt`
- [ ] Set start command: `cd backend && python start_production.py`
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy service

### Frontend Service
- [ ] Create new Static Site
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- [ ] Set publish directory: `frontend/.next`
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy service

## üåê Environment Variables

### Backend (Auto-configured by Blueprint)
- [ ] `PYTHON_VERSION`: 3.9.16
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL`: sqlite:///./rental.db
- [ ] `HOST`: 0.0.0.0
- [ ] `DEBUG`: false

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend API
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `/health`
- [ ] Root endpoint responds: `/`
- [ ] Dashboard endpoint works: `/dashboard`
- [ ] CORS allows frontend requests
- [ ] Database is accessible
- [ ] Logs are being generated

### Frontend
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] API calls to backend succeed
- [ ] Dashboard displays data
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] Build size is reasonable

### Integration
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Data flows between services
- [ ] Real-time updates work

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- [ ] Build failures - Check requirements and build logs
- [ ] CORS errors - Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [ ] Database errors - Check database file and initialization
- [ ] Port conflicts - Verify PORT environment variable
- [ ] Memory issues - Check free plan limits

### Debug Steps
- [ ] Enable debug mode temporarily
- [ ] Check Render service logs
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Test endpoints individually
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

## üìà Success Metrics

### Performance
- [ ] Backend API responds in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Frontend loads in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Database queries complete quickly
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes

### Reliability
- [ ] Services stay running for 24+ hours
- [ ] Automatic restarts work if needed
- [ ] Health checks pass consistently
- [ ] Error handling works properly

## üéØ Next Steps

### After Successful Deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Plan for scaling and upgrades
- [ ] Document deployment process

### Production Considerations
